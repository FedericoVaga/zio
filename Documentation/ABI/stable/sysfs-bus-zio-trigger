Description:	This is a collection of ZIO trigger attributes. It
		contains both: standard attributes (described later) and
		extended attributes defined by each driver (not described
		in this document). This collection refers to a single
		instance of a trigger implementation. Each trigger
		implementation can decide to support or not the standard
		attributes; if it supports the standard attributes it
		works as described in this document.

		Finally, remember that there is a trigger instance of the
		same implementation for	each channel-set of your devices

		Note: The permission on the standard attributes depend on
		the trigger implementation
