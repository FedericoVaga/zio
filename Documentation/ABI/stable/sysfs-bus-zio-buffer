Description:	This is a collection of ZIO buffer attributes. It
		contains both: standard attributes (described later) and
		extended attributes defined by each driver (not described
		in this document). This collection refers to a single
		instance of a buffer implementation. Each buffer
		implementation can decide to support or not the standard
		attributes; if it supports the standard attributes it
		works as described in this document.

		Finally, remember that there is a buffer instance of the
		same implementation for	each channel within the same
		channel-set of your devices

		Note: The permission on the standard attributes depend on
		the buffer implementation
